# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # Start dev server at localhost:4321
pnpm build        # Static build to dist/
pnpm preview      # Preview the built site
pnpm typecheck    # astro check (type-checks .astro + .ts files)

Commit messages must follow conventional commits (`type(scope): subject`) — enforced by commitlint at commit time.

## Architecture

Astro 6 site, static output — everything under `src/` is rendered at build time, no SSR adapter. Docs at `/docs/*` are rendered by the Starlight integration configured in `astro.config.mjs`; every other page uses `BaseLayout`. The one exception to "static" is `functions/`, a Cloudflare Pages Functions directory that sits alongside the static build (not part of Astro/Vite at all — Cloudflare's own build step picks it up).

```
src/pages/               ← routes (index, 404, privacy, terms; docs routes come from Starlight)
src/components/          ← Astro components (marketing) + docs/ (MDX components) + starlight/ (Starlight overrides)
src/layouts/             ← BaseLayout (every non-docs page; docs pages use Starlight's shell)
src/content/docs/        ← MDX doc pages (the Starlight docs collection)
src/content.config.ts    ← content layer config: Starlight docsLoader + docsSchema (NOT src/content/config.ts)
src/data/docsGames.ts    ← typed per-game docs data; drives the docs table/facts components
src/lib/github.ts        ← GitHub Releases API (build-time only): getLatestRelease, getRecentReleases
src/lib/mod-index.ts     ← build-time recognized-mod count from index-stats.json (never index.db)
src/lib/mod-index-shared.ts ← stats asset URL + payload type, shared with the browser refresh in Features
src/lib/os-detect.ts     ← detectOs(): shared client-side OS detection for Hero/DownloadSection/Nav
src/styles/global.css    ← imports tokens + shared utilities + mobile breakpoints
src/styles/starlight.css ← docs-only styling layered over Starlight (loaded via customCss)
src/styles/tokens/       ← design tokens (fonts, colors, typography, spacing, base, components)
functions/api/collect.ts ← Cloudflare Pages Function, see "API (Cloudflare Pages Functions)" below
functions/install.sh.ts  ← Cloudflare Pages Function serving modrex.net/install.sh, see below
```

### API (Cloudflare Pages Functions)

`functions/api/collect.ts` is a near-transparent proxy for the desktop app's analytics: it forwards `POST /api/collect` (query string + body) to GA4's Measurement Protocol `mp/collect` endpoint. It exists because DNS-level/hosts-file blocklists and outbound firewalls commonly block `google-analytics.com` itself, for every process on a machine — not just browsers — and modrex-main's audience runs that tooling heavily; routing through `modrex.net` means the request only has to survive being blocked by name, not by Google's domain. See `modrex-main/src-tauri/src/commands/analytics.rs` for the other half. File-based routing: a file at `functions/<path>.ts` maps to that route (`functions/api/collect.ts` → `/api/collect`); export `onRequestPost`/`onRequestGet`/etc. per HTTP method. Deploys automatically alongside the static site via the existing Cloudflare Pages Git integration — no separate build step, not part of `pnpm build`/`pnpm typecheck` (Astro's checker doesn't walk this directory, confirmed: `astro check` only reports on files under `src/`).

**Not an open relay**: the function requires `measurement_id` + `api_secret` query params (400 otherwise) and pins `measurement_id` to Modrex's own GA4 property - exact match against the `MODREX_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` Pages env var when set, otherwise a `G-[A-Z0-9]{4,}` shape check (403 on mismatch) - so modrex.net can't be used as a generic unauthenticated relay into arbitrary GA4 accounts. **Fire-and-forget**: it returns 204 immediately and performs the upstream fetch inside `waitUntil`; the desktop client never reads the response, and upstream failures are deliberately unobserved.

**Geolocation fix**: the one place this function isn't a pure byte passthrough. Since Google sees the request coming from this function's own outbound `fetch`, not the desktop app's connection, GA4 would otherwise geolocate every single user as wherever Cloudflare's network egresses from — not their real country. The function reads `CF-Connecting-IP` (set by Cloudflare's edge from the real TCP connection; not spoofable by the client) and injects it as a top-level `ip_override` field in the forwarded JSON body, which is GA4's documented mechanism for exactly this server-side-proxy scenario. Absent under local `wrangler pages dev` (no real edge involved) — forwards fine, just without geo correction in that case.

### Install script (`functions/install.sh.ts`)

Serves `modrex.net/install.sh`, the `curl -fsSL https://modrex.net/install.sh | sh` entry point for Linux installs (the mget engine also handles macOS, but Modrex ships no macOS build). It implements the "Worker integration" contract from `mget`'s README (`C:\local\modrexio\mget`): resolve an engine pin to a real mget tag, fetch the project config, concatenate, stream.

- **Engine pin**: `ENGINE_PIN = 'v1'` (bare major), resolved on every request to the newest `v1.x.x` tag via the GitHub **tags** API, never the Releases API (mget tags are not GitHub releases) and never `@main` (a bad mget push must not break every install instantly). An exact-tag pin (`v1.1.0`) skips the API call entirely; `latest` is supported but deliberately unused for modrex.
- **Config**: fetched from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modrexio/modrex/main/install.config.json` at request time, so `install.config.json` changes take effect on push to modrex-main with no site deploy.
- **Output**: a single `#!/bin/sh` script: the config flattened into `CFG_*` exports, then the engine body with its own shebang stripped (only one shebang may survive). `shellQuote` single-quotes every config value, escaping embedded quotes with `'"'"'` - this is the injection barrier between config data and shell code; never simplify it.
- **Failure shape**: any fetch failure returns HTTP 502 whose body is itself a valid shell script (`# reason` then `exit 1`), so `curl | sh` fails cleanly instead of piping an error page into `sh`.
- Served with `Cache-Control: no-store` - the script is fetched once per install, so always serving the current engine/config beats caching. GitHub API calls send a `User-Agent` header (GitHub rejects unauthenticated requests without one).

### Data flow

`getLatestRelease()` in `src/lib/github.ts` is called in `src/pages/index.astro` at build time with a try/catch fallback to `null`. The `release` object is passed as a prop to `Nav`, `Hero`, and `DownloadSection` — all three must handle `release: Release | null`. `getRecentReleases(3)` feeds `Changelog.astro` the same way (fallback: empty array, which renders no changelog entries); it over-fetches and filters out drafts and prereleases.

GitHub API calls attach an optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` (Pages env var): unauthenticated builds share 60 requests/hour per IP, which shared CI build IPs can exhaust, silently degrading release data; the token raises the limit to 5000/hour, and API error messages state GitHub's own explanation plus whether a token was present.

The recognized-mod count uses `getModIndexStats()` at build time only as a fallback. `Features.astro` refreshes the rendered number in the browser from the `index-stats.json` release asset generated by `modrex-index` (URL + payload type live in `src/lib/mod-index-shared.ts`, shared by both sides); do not make visitors or the build download `index.db` just to render the count.

### Styling rules

- All colors are CSS custom properties defined in `src/styles/tokens/colors.css` via Tailwind v4's `@theme`. Never use hardcoded Tailwind color classes (`zinc-*`, `red-*`, etc.). Token names: `surface`, `surface-raised`, `surface-hover`, `surface-active`, `surface-light`, `border`, `text`, `text-muted`, `text-subtle`, `accent`, `accent-bright`, `accent-fill-hover`, `danger`, `danger-hover`, `danger-text`, `success`, `success-text`, `warning`. Tint variables (raw CSS props, not Tailwind classes): `--accent-tint-10/20/30`, `--warning-tint-10/30`, `--scrim` (modal backdrop `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`).
- Tailwind is loaded via `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin (not `@astrojs/tailwind`).
- `tokens/fonts.css` must be imported **before** `@import 'tailwindcss'` in `global.css` to avoid PostCSS ordering errors with Google Fonts `@import url()`.
- Shared layout utilities (`.wrap`, `.btn-lg`, `.sec-head`) live in `global.css`. Component-specific styles use Astro scoped `<style>` blocks. (`.doc-prose` in `global.css` is dead CSS from the pre-Starlight docs layout — nothing references it.)
- MDX-rendered content cannot receive scoped styles from parent components — use `:global()` or add styles to `global.css` (`starlight.css` for docs pages).

**Mobile breakpoints** (defined in `global.css` for shared utilities; in component `<style>` blocks for component-specific layout):

- `768px` — nav switches to hamburger, `.wrap` padding shrinks to `16px` (docs-layout responsiveness is Starlight's own plus `starlight.css` overrides, not these breakpoints)
- `860px` / `500px` — features grid: 3-col → 2-col → 1-col
- `640px` — hero inner padding/font size reductions, download section 2-col → 1-col, gallery nav buttons switch to absolute overlays on the card edges
- `480px` — section title font size floor (`32px`)

### OS detection

Client-side OS detection is shared: `detectOs()` in `src/lib/os-detect.ts` returns `{ isMobile, isLinux }` and is imported by the three components with download buttons — `Hero.astro`, `DownloadSection.astro`, `Nav.astro`. The `isMobile` check is two-part: a UA pattern for standard mobile devices plus a `maxTouchPoints` branch for iPadOS 13+, which reports its user agent as macOS.

On mobile: no OS highlight or badge is shown, and the hero button shows a generic "Download" label. On desktop Linux: switch to Linux assets (the install command is the one-liner served by `functions/install.sh.ts`). On desktop Windows/other: default to Windows assets. Change detection logic only in `os-detect.ts`.

### Analytics & consent

`BaseLayout.astro` includes GA4 (measurement ID `G-51PXP0HVZD`) with Consent Mode v2. Analytics tracking is **denied by default** and only enabled after the user accepts via `CookieBanner.astro`.

Key constraint: ESLint's `prefer-rest-params` rule fires inside `<script is:inline>` blocks, and each block is treated as an independent scope (`no-undef` fires on bare globals from another block). The gtag function uses rest params and `window.` prefix throughout:

```js
window.gtag = function (...args) {
    window.dataLayer.push(args)
}
```

`CookieBanner.astro` stores consent in `localStorage` (`cookie_consent = 'granted' | 'denied'`) and calls `window.gtag('consent', 'update', ...)` on accept. It renders at the bottom-left corner of every `BaseLayout` page.

GA4 and the consent banner exist only on `BaseLayout` pages (`index`, `privacy`, `terms`, `404`) — Starlight docs pages load neither; their `Head` override adds structured data only.

### SEO

`astro.config.mjs` sets `site: 'https://modrex.net'` — this powers `Astro.site` and `Astro.url` throughout the app. The sitemap integration auto-generates `/sitemap-index.xml` at build time from all static routes, excluding `/privacy` and `/terms` via its `filter`.

`BaseLayout.astro` emits: `<meta name="description">`, `<link rel="canonical">`, Open Graph tags (`og:title/description/image/url/type/site_name`), and Twitter card tags. The default `og:image` is `/logo.png` resolved to an absolute URL via `new URL('/logo.png', Astro.site)`. `BaseLayout` has a `<slot name="head" />` inside `<head>` for page-specific injections.

`src/pages/index.astro` injects a `SoftwareApplication` JSON-LD block via `<script type="application/ld+json" is:inline set:html={...} slot="head">`. The `is:inline` directive is required when using `set:html` on a script tag.

Docs pages get their structured data from the Starlight `Head` override (`src/components/starlight/Head.astro`): a `BreadcrumbList` per docs page (section labels for `games`/`concepts`) and a `HowTo` block on `/docs/getting-started`. A `google-site-verification` meta tag is injected on docs pages via the `head` array in the starlight config.

`public/robots.txt` allows all crawlers and points to the sitemap URL. If the domain changes, update `site` in `astro.config.mjs`, the sitemap URL in `robots.txt`, and the `url`/`downloadUrl` in the JSON-LD in `index.astro` — all three must match.

### Static assets

`public/icons/` contains SVG icons for platforms (`windows`, `linux`) and launchers (`steam`, `epicgames`, `xbox`) in normal and `-white` variants (e.g. `steam-white.svg`). Use the `-white` variants in the dark-only UI. In MDX files, always use self-closing `<img />` — bare `<img>` causes an MDX parse error.

### Icons

Lucide icons via the `lucide` package (not `lucide-react`). In each component that needs icons: import `createIcons` + the specific icons, call `createIcons({ icons: { ... } })` inside a `<script>` block. Use `<i data-lucide="icon-name">` in markup. Add `display: block` to both `i` and `svg` selectors to avoid inline-element alignment issues.

### Nav mobile menu

At `≤768px`, `.nav-links` and `.nav-right` are hidden and a hamburger button appears. Clicking it toggles `.open` on `#mobile-menu`, which drops down below the nav bar with all links plus a download button. The menu closes on any link click. The mobile download button mirrors the OS detection logic from the desktop button.

### Docs (Starlight)

- `/docs/*` is rendered by `@astrojs/starlight`, configured entirely in `astro.config.mjs` — sidebar structure, code theme, component overrides, and social links all live there, not in a layout file.
- Sidebar nav is the `sidebar` array in `astro.config.mjs`: the "Games" and "Concepts" groups autogenerate from `src/content/docs/docs/games/` and `.../concepts/`; the other entries are explicit slugs. Update the array when adding/removing pages outside the autogenerated directories.
- `/docs/` is a real page (`src/content/docs/docs/index.mdx`), not a redirect — it's the docs landing page; `/docs/getting-started` is the separate install guide it links to.
- Starlight renders `h1` from `title` and the lead paragraph from `description` frontmatter — don't repeat these inside the MDX body.
- Component overrides in `src/components/starlight/`: `Header` renders the site's own `Nav` (`activePage="docs"`); `Sidebar` injects the custom client-side docs filter (`Search.astro`, a `site-search` custom element) above Starlight's sidebar internals; `DarkThemeProvider` pins docs to dark (clears `starlight-theme` from localStorage and stubs the theme-picker API); `Head` adds the structured data described under SEO, then defers to Starlight's default Head.
- Fenced code blocks go through Expressive Code with the inline `modrexCodeTheme` in `astro.config.mjs` — its hex values are deliberately duplicated from `tokens/colors.css` because Shiki themes can't reference CSS variables; keep them in sync when tokens change.
- `disable404Route: true` — the site's own `src/pages/404.astro` handles 404s for docs URLs too.
- Custom MDX components live in `src/components/docs/`: `Callout` (default `type="info"`, or `type="warning"`) plus the game-docs family (`GameFacts`, `GameSupportTable`, `LauncherMatrix`, `LauncherSupportTable`, `ModTargetsTable`, `SupportBadge`, `OsIcon`, `LauncherIcon`). Starlight's own `CardGrid`/`LinkCard` are used too. Each must be imported at the top of the MDX file that uses it.
- Yes/no table cells render `SupportBadge` — the old shields.io badge images are gone; don't reintroduce remote badge URLs.
- The game tables/facts are driven by `src/data/docsGames.ts` (typed, per-game) — add or change game data there, not inline in MDX.
- Docs-specific styling (including responsive layout) lives in `src/styles/starlight.css`, loaded via the starlight `customCss` option.

### Hero gallery

Infinite carousel in `Hero.astro`: slots carry **two clones per edge** (`CLONES` in the frontmatter) — a wrap step travels onto the first clone and the second keeps a neighbor sliver visible beyond it (one clone left a blank viewport edge during the wrap). The script derives the real range from which card the server marked `active`, so the clone count is stated once. One `createCarousel()` factory drives both the hero track and the fullscreen viewer track. Steps are animated with the **Web Animations API, not CSS transitions** (the tracks deliberately have no `transition: transform`): the committed `style.transform` is set to the step's final position up front and the animation only overlays the travel, so a canceled/interrupted step can never strand the track mid-flight, and completion is `anim.onfinish` — a guaranteed callback, unlike `transitionend`, which is silently lost when a transition is canceled (e.g. by the ResizeObserver repositioning mid-step) or never starts. That event loss froze the gallery in the old CSS-transition design; do not reintroduce a transition on the tracks or an `animating` lock flag. When a step lands on a clone, `onfinish` teleports to the real twin via `place()` (card transitions suppressed for two frames to avoid the highlight blink); a step _started_ from a not-yet-teleported clone folds the wrap into its start position (`from ± SPAN * stride()`). There is no step lock — rapid clicks retarget the animation from the current rendered position (`getComputedStyle` + `DOMMatrixReadOnly`). Card width is `74%` on desktop (`flex: 0 0 74%`) and `88%` on mobile (`flex: 0 0 88%`); the JS reads rendered width from the DOM (`cardEls[REAL_FIRST].offsetWidth`) so no ratio is hardcoded. On mobile (`≤640px`), the nav buttons are `position: absolute` overlays centered on the left/right edges of the active card (`left/right: 6%` — derived from `(100% - 88%) / 2`).

## Agent skills

Reusable skills live in `.agents/skills/` and are listed in `AGENTS.md`. Available as Claude Code slash commands:

- `/commit` — read the current diff and propose a conventional commit message; waits for confirmation before committing.

`/deslop` has no shim in this repo — run it from a session at the workspace root (`C:\local\modrexio`) as `/deslop modrex-site`; its site-specific rules live in the root skill.

## Local Pages Function testing

```bash
pnpm build && npx wrangler pages dev dist   # serves /api/collect and /install.sh locally
curl -fsSL http://localhost:8788/install.sh | sh -n   # syntax-check the assembled script without running it
```

`astro check` and `pnpm typecheck` do not cover `functions/` — TypeScript errors there are only caught at deploy time or via manual `tsc` invocation.

## Rules

- Never run any git command that touches the remote (push, force push). Write out the command for the user to run.
- Commit messages must follow conventional commits — enforced by `commitlint.config.ts`.
- The site is deployed on **Cloudflare Pages** (not GitHub Pages). If a Jekyll/GitHub Pages build failure appears in CI, it can be ignored or GitHub Pages can be disabled in repo settings.
